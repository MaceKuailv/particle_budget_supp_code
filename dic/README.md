# Recreate the biogeochemisty example

To reproduce, you first need to substitute the file in `mitgcm_run` into the mitgcm. You will find the corresponding files in `pkg/dic` and `verification/tutorial_global_oce_biogeo`.

Next, run the notebook in the `eulerian_budget` folder and then the `lagrangian_budget` folder. They are marked in order.
